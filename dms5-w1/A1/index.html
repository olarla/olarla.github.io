      <h2>Software Genre</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Genre:</strong> Orb.Farm is an **ecosystem simulation** that
        blends scientific modeling with open-ended sandbox mechanics.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Similar Software:</strong></p>

      <h2>Interactive Features</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Self-Sustaining Ecosystem:</strong> Users introduce and manage
          species while observing their natural interactions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Dynamic Oxygen & Nutrient Cycles:</strong> Photosynthesis,
          respiration, and decomposition create a constantly changing
          environment.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Realistic Fluid Behavior:</strong> Water and air interact,
          creating organic movement and flow.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>User-Driven Experimentation:</strong> No fixed
          objectivesâ€”users experiment and shape the world freely.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Genre Alignment</h2>
      <p>
        Orb.Farm fits within ecosystem simulation and sandbox mechanics by
        allowing players to create, modify, and passively observe the balance of
        an artificial biosphere.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Novel Features</h2>
      <p>
        Unlike typical digital sandboxes, Orb.Farm introduces an **organic food
        chain and resource management**, making it feel more like an interactive
        ecosystem rather than a physics experiment.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Missing Features</h2>
      <p>
        Adding unpredictable weather changes, a predator-prey evolution system,
        or pollution mechanics could make the ecosystem even richer.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Target Audience</h2>
      <p>
        The software is likely to attract biology enthusiasts, creative
        thinkers, and those who enjoy watching complex systems unfold naturally.
      </p>

      <h2>User Experience</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Annoying Aspects:</strong> The limited variety of species and
        environments can make long-term play feel repetitive.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Enjoyable Aspects:</strong> Observing unexpected interactions,
        such as bacteria overpopulating and crashing the oxygen supply, makes
        every attempt unique.
